"Our electronic communications are constantly surveilled by the NSA or the "

" pour over our data as it flows under the sea or through the ether. Sent in "
"the clear, it's \"trivial\" to dig through it, as the hackers like to say. So"
" we're asked to encrypt it, to obfuscate it in some way. Yet encryption is "
"not a panacea, for it too can be bypassed in a plethora of ways. We seem to "
"be stuck in a catch-22, damned if we do, damned if we don't. So we feel a "

"You might wonder what these codes could be. Well, remember Eugenio Dittborn, "

"of Chile. Or remember that tale of Borges, where an agent kills a man with "
"the same name as a secret location, in order to transmit this information to "
"his handlers through a newspaper headline. There's the artist Kate Rich, who "
"in \"Feral Trade\", allows anyone to request that strangers bring you "
"foodstuffs from far-off corners of the globe. Perhaps you have a special way "
"of communicating with a friend or partner. Maybe you had a secret language as"
" a child. Or you communicate the most amazing insights through a poem. All of"
