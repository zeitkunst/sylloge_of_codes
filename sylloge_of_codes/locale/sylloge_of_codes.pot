#. Default: This is a time when electronic communications are surveilled the
#. world over. Little seems to escape the computer programs and human analysts
#. that pour over our electronic data as it traverses national boundaries
#. through undersea cables or the wireless ether. Sent in the clear, our data
#. is understandable by anyone with a bit of technical knowledge. So we're
#. asked to encrypt it, to obfuscate it in some way. But these same programs
#. and analysts have made these encryption techniques weak, opening backdoors
#. into seemingly secure communications. What we're left feeling is
#. helplessness, a distinct lack of power to respond, and a dangerous level of
#. cynicism.

#. Default: So if we can't trust that our messages pass from one person to
#. another without being surveilled, no matter what computational steps we
#. take, what can we do? We can think more poetically. Computers are rather
#. silly machines, only able to "understand" the most basic means of
#. information. They are horrible at dealing with the poetic, with sarcasm,
#. with hidden messages, pidgin, and nuanced meanings. They cannot handle the
#. unquantifiable.

#. Default: This implies that we should be developing new, more poetic forms of
#. communication that are resistant to analysis by computers. So consider this
#. an invitation, an invitation to create a sylloge of codes. A sylloge is a
#. collection, a reference to the dark ages where travellers would record
#. ancient Roman and Greek inscriptions. We too will create a new sylloge of
#. alternative forms of communication.
