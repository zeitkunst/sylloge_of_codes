                    <p i18n:translate="firstP">This is a time when electronic communications are surveilled the world over.  Little seems to escape the computer programs and human analysts that pour over our electronic data as it traverses national boundaries through undersea cables or the wireless ether.  Sent in the clear, our data is understandable by anyone with a bit of technical knowledge.  So we're asked to encrypt it, to obfuscate it in some way.  But these same programs and analysts have made these encryption techniques weak, opening backdoors into seemingly secure communications.  What we're left feeling is helplessness, a distinct lack of power to respond, and a dangerous level of cynicism.</p>
                    <p i18n:translate="secondP">So if we can't trust that our messages pass from one person to another without being surveilled, no matter what computational steps we take, what can we do? We can think more poetically. Computers are rather silly machines, only able to "understand" the most basic means of information. They are horrible at dealing with the poetic, with sarcasm, with hidden messages, pidgin, and nuanced meanings. They cannot handle the unquantifiable.</p>
                    <p i18n:translate="thirdP">This implies that we should be developing new, more poetic forms of communication that are resistant to analysis by computers. So consider this an invitation, an invitation to create a sylloge of codes. A sylloge is a collection, a reference to the dark ages where travellers would record ancient Roman and Greek inscriptions. We too will create a new sylloge of alternative forms of communication. </p>
