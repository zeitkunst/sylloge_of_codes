"Thanks for showing my piece *sylloge of codes*! I wanted to provide some "
"info regarding the piece and how to manage it. It's important to read "
"through all of the instructions below to understand how the piece functions "

"The piece consists of the box, and a Raspberry Pi computer running Debian "
"Linux and pico projector inside. On the Raspberry Pi is custom software that"
" I have written. Also, there are two wireless modules attached to the Pi "
"(one is currently unused). The wireless module creates a local wireless "
"network that visitors to the piece can connect to. This module is not "
"connected to the internet, and thus does not allow visitors any external "
"internet access."
